## Overview

### The challenge

This challenge mostly focuses on HTML, CSS and JavaScript 

The users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.

By the way I designed the branding of RJelectronics: the logo using Adobe Illustrator, some social media graphics with Adobe Photoshop and video-logo animation usign After Effects. Web development I think will help this little enterpreneur to show on the web its services.
